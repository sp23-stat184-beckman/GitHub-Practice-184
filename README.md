# GitHub Pages Assignment

**(10 pts) Assignment Instructions**

- Create your own GitHub profile/ID (appropriate for job or grad school applications)  
- Create a new repo & initialize it with a "readme" (always)  
    - GitHub will suggest a silly name like `redesigned-garbanzo`, you can stick with that or create a new name. 
- Locate class repo
    - Find "sp23-stat184-beckman" in GitHub and locate the "GitHub-Practice-184" class repo
    - Click on "README.md" >> Edit (pencil icon in upper right)
- **Add a row** in the table below with your information--do not delete other entries
    - follow the pattern for the vertical bar character (next to the "]" key)... use the "Matthew Beckman" row as a template
    - (2 pts) first & last name  
    - (1 pt)  home town
    - (2 pts) github id  
    - (2 pts) url for a GitHub Repo that YOU created... notice that my GitHub id is in the middle of the URL  
    - (1 pt) use the "Preview" button at top of the editor view to check your work and then back to "Edit file" to fix any issues  
            - repeat until it looks right  
            - Tip: be sure you matched the sequence for "|" characters and text! It's okay if vertical alignment isn't perfect, but the sequence matters  
    - (2 pts) commit your changes and submit pull request   
            - write a **descriptive** commit message (e.g. "added Matt Beckman to class table")  
            - click green button "Propose file change" & start pull request  
    - (ungraded) pat yourself on the back

**Important**: Your entry will NOT appear on the class table right away.  Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "master" before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.
